Source: Brian Lagerstrom

## Ingredients

- 220 g or 1 cup warm water
- 7 g or 2 1/4 tsp instant yeast
- 3 g or 2/3 tsp baking soda
- 8 g or 2 tsp sugar
- 5 g or 1 tsp  salt
- 15 g or 1 1/4 tbsp olive oil
- 360 g or 3 cups gluten free ap flour (i recommend king arthur or bob’s red mill 1 to 1)
- Pizza sauce and toppings

## Prep

- Before cooking heat oven to 500 F with pizza stone or steel inside

## Directions

- Into a medium/large bowl, add water, yeast, baking soda, sugar, salt, olive oil, and flour.
- Stir to combine.
- Once a ball begins to form, switch to using a soaking wet hand to finish mixing until a ball is formed.
- Cover and allow to “rise” on the counter for 90 minutes.
- Divide into 2 even pieces and round each into a ball.
- Add a little water if ball is crumbly.
- Oil 2 pieces parchment and place ball between them.
- Use large flat object to press into wide round, then rolling pin to spread out to 12" rounds.
  - Gently push the dough out, don't roll it, rolling will crack the dough.
- Discard the top parchment paper.
- Mark dough with 12" pan or object and cut off extra dough.
- Use butter knife to gently push in edges and create a lip.
- Add pizza sauce and toppings.
- Gently transfer pizza with paper under it to the pizza stone.
- Cook for 7 minutes and remove to cool for a couple minutes.
- Remove from parchment paper and return to pizza stone for 2-3 minutes to crisp the crust.
